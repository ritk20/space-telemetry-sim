# space-telemetry-sim 
This is a C++ simulation of a spacecraft telemetry system.

It models onboard sensors generating real-time data, buffered transmission over TCP, and ground-station reception with compression and logging.

The project will hopefully demonstrate multithreading, data serialization, socket communication, and systems-level design inspired by real satellite telemetry architectures (by the time it's done).
